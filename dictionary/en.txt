2~Demo of PHP class CaesarCipher
3~Select the text language, encryption key and the text you want to encrypt
4~Language of the text
5~Key of the encryption
6~Ciphertext using key: {}
7~Decrypted text using known key
8~Breaking the cipher using the BruteForceDecoding method
9~Key defined: {MaxRatingKey} for text with maximum rating: {MaxRating}
10~Results for all possible encryption keys
11~Text rating: {rating} key: {key}
12~Cracking the cipher using the DecodingByCharacterFrequency method
13~Breaking the cipher using this method is not possible. Use BruteForceDecoding method
14~space
15~In the ciphertext, the most frequently repeated character: '{character}', ordinal number in the alphabet: {indA}
16~Key defined: {MaxRatingKey} for text with maximum rating: {MaxRating}
17~Decrypted text rating: {keyRating}, most frequently repeated character: '{character}',
sequence number in the alphabet {decoded}, key: {indA} - {decoded} = {key}
